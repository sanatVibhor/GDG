1. map() → Return names of all users
2. filter() → Get only active users
3. find() → Find the user named "Charlie"
4. reduce() → Calculate the total age of all users
5. some() → Check if there is any user below age 24

7. forEach() → Print each user's name and age
8. includes() → Check if "Eva" has "yoga" as a hobby
9. sort() → Sort users by age in descending order
10. flatMap() or map + flat() → Create one array of all hobbies
